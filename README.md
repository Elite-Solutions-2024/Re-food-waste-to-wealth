### Abstract:
This project aims to create a web platform that connects hotels with industries to manage surplus food. Hotels can list their surplus food, and industries can browse and acquire it for various purposes like animal feed or bio energy production. The platform promotes collaboration between hospitality and industrial sectors, offering a sustainable solution for food waste management. The web-based platform provides a scalable and sustainable solution for hotel food waste management, encouraging collaboration among stakeholders in the hospitality and industrial sectors.
#
## Problem Statement:
There exists a lack of efficient communication and collaboration between hotels  which generate surplus food  and industries which can utilize this surplus to produce biogas and vermicompost from organic waste. This disconnect results in missed opportunities for resource recovery in industries.
#
## Solution:
To address this challenge, we propose the development of a website that acts as a mediator between hotels and industries. The website will provide information to hotels about industries that specialize in converting leftover food and organic waste into biogas and vermicompost. Hotels can then contact these industries to arrange for the transfer of their surplus food and organic waste, reducing food waste in hotels and promoting resource recovery in industries.
